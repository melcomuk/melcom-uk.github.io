      "MELCom UK Statement in solidarity with the Palestinian people and a plea for peace",
      "The UK Middle East Libraries Committee stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people. We condemn the attacks on Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem and the ongoing apartheid, dispossession and erasure of Palestinians.",
      "We are not remaining silent in the wake of renewed acts of violence towards peoples whose history our profession is founded upon, when calling out for the decolonisation of our bookshelves.",
      "With this statement, we affirm our own commitment to speaking out in defence of peace, justice, human rights and dignity of the Palestinian people, who have been disproportionally effected by the attacks. We reaffirm our commitment against all forms of racism, including antisemitism, Islamophobia and anti-Arabism.",
      "We also learn with sadness of losses to Palestinian cultural heritage with the complete destruction of Samir Mansour and Shaaban Aslem’s book shop Iqra, two of the largest bookshops of Gaza, and of the raid and vandalism by Israeli armed forces of the arts centre and archive of Dar Jacir in Bethlehem.",
      "We call on all academic communities, cultural institutions and especially libraries and archives with a connection to Middle Eastern Studies to add their voices and act in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle.",
      "We affirm the statement of our sister organization MELA.",

      "MELCom UK statement on Black Lives Matter",
      "The Middle East Libraries Committee United Kingdom (MELCom UK) is committed to equality, inclusion and working towards social justice for all. We condemn the systemic racism and injustices that have been meted on the black community, which has resulted in the brutal killings of George Floyd, and others, and stand in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement protesting his killing and wider injustices.",
      "MELCom UK stands with the Black community and all other underrepresented and underprivileged communities against all forms of racism, whether overt, insidious, or structural, and we encourage our members to do the same.",
      "Racism and discrimination are experienced by marginalised and disadvantaged community members every day, and the library profession is not exempt from these scourges. It is vital for people of conscience to become engaged in some form of raising awareness and actively calling out and condemning all forms of racism.",
      "We, therefore, encourage our members to engage with members of the underrepresented communities, whether colleagues or library service users, to understand their reality and to understand the challenges they encounter on a daily basis. It is essential that we, as librarians and information professionals, take it upon ourselves to further research these issues and engage with initiatives at our institutions and on professional, academic, or social platforms. The burden should not always be on the marginalised to educate others on such issues. The lack of diversity within the library profession has been well documented to be an ongoing concern for an exceptionally long time.",
      "In an attempt to address such concerns, MELCom UK will engage our membership and raise awareness to address such issues. MELCom UK and the library profession must be part of the solution and we will endeavour to address this resolutely. MELCom UK, as an organisation representing a portion of the “Global South,” is well placed to encourage and aide the wider library profession to become more inclusive and representative. Therefore, we are committed to assist librarians, academics, book suppliers, booksellers, and publishers to support their decolonisation and diversification efforts, and in doing so, to become more representative of the stakeholders and regions they purport to study or represent.",
